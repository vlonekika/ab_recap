## A/B Test Duration Optimization Study

`ab_part1.ipynb`

This research explores the paradoxical relationship between test duration and statistical power in A/B testing. Using real-world streaming platform data, we demonstrate how longer observation periods can unexpectedly reduce test sensitivity despite larger sample sizes. The analysis reveals that extended timeframes introduce behavioral variance from irregular users, ultimately diminishing detection capability for meaningful effects.

Our findings challenge conventional "longer-is-better" testing approaches and provide framework for optimizing experiment duration based on user engagement patterns.
